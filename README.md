## üìö Project Purpose & Tech Stack  
- **Platform used**: PostgreSQL (pcAdmin or any SQL client)  
- **Technical focus**: SQL window functions, string parsing, aggregations, filtering  
- **Business relevance**: Content mix analysis, regional trends, metadata completeness, sentiment insights

## üß† Why This Project Stands Out  
- Covers **15+ business questions** with concise SQL‚Äîdemonstrates analytical thinking and SQL depth.  
- Each query linked to a **strategic insight**, showcasing storytelling ability.  
- **Clean documentation**‚Äîideal for recruiters or technical reviewers (per best practices).
